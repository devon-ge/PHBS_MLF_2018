# This is the spider to crawl pictures

The pictures we crawled from [**Toopen**](http://www.tooopen.com/img/87.aspx) are stored
in [`images/full`](../images/full) directory. Every picture's name is the SHA1 hash of its url.

The following steps helps you to reproduce the result.

1. Clone this repository to your local disk

    `$ git clone https://github.com/devon-ge/PHBS_MLF_2018.git`

2. Change to `tooopen_img` directory (root directory of this spider that contains `scrapy.cfg` and this `README.md`)

    `$ cd PHBS_MLF_2018/tooopen_img`
3. Run command `$ scrapy crawl tooopen[ -s CLOSESPIDER_ITEMCOUNT=60]`

Now, you can check the pictures in [`images/full`](../images/full) (automatically generated by
scrapy).

**Warning**: In step 3, `60` is the maximum number of item requests (you can use whatever you want).
The spider will keep running until all *nature* pictures are crawled if we
omit `CLOSESPIDER_ITEMCOUNT` option. That's time consuming!
